How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I use a Scrum-Agile approach allowing me to prioritize through testing and code review thorough the development process. 

I implement unit tests and integration tests to catch bugs early. To interpret user needs, I engage in regular communication with stakeholders via email, meetings, or surveys to gather feedback which I then incorporate into my program's features. When designing software, I follow a Scrum-Agile framework: I start with defining clear requirements through user stories, I am also capable of creating wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user interface and experience. 
This iterative process allows me to refine the design based on user feedback before final implementation, ensuring that the final product meets both functional and security standards.
